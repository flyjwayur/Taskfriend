## Task Friend

I came up with idea for an application which helps to,,

- first, brainstorm ideas together as a team,
- Secondly, plan sprint together based on ideas as a team such as Trello/Kanban
- Third, have own todo list and calender indiviually based on team plan

* Demo : https://taskfriend.netlify.com/
